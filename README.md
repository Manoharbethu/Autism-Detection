# 🧠 Autism-Detection
Developing Accurate Diagnostic Tools via Classification Models <br/>
This repository documents the development of a machine learning model designed for the early and accurate detection of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in children. By analyzing a combination of behavioral, cognitive, and demographic data, this project aims to create a highly efficient and accessible diagnostic tool.
# 🎯 Key Project Objectives <br/>
Improve Early Identification: To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of ASD detection to enable timely intervention and support. <br/>
Leverage Advanced Analytics: To utilize machine learning to identify subtle indicators of autism that might be missed by conventional clinical assessments. <br/>
Process Diverse Data: To analyze various data inputs, including behavioral patterns and features from a collected dataset. <br/>
# 🛠️ Project Structure and Technologies <br/>
The core of the project involves extensive data preprocessing, including dropping missing values and utilizing techniques like MinMaxScaler and One-Hot Encoding. <br/>
Dependencies <br/>
The analysis relies heavily on the Scikit-learn ecosystem and Python's data stack: <br/>
Data Manipulation: pandas and numpy. <br/>
Visualization: matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn. <br/>
Machine Learning (Scikit-learn): RandomForestClassifier, LogisticRegression, DecisionTreeClassifier, KNeighborsClassifier. <br/>
Model Selection: GridSearchCV and train_test_split. <br/>
Preprocessing: MinMaxScaler and StandardScaler (as explored in the report).
